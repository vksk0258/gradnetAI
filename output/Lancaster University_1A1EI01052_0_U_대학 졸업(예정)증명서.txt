HIGHER EDUCATION ACHIEVEMENT REPORT
(Diploma Supplement)
This Higher Education Achievement Report incorporates the model developed by the European Commission Council of Europe and UNESCOICEPES
for the Diploma Supplement
The purpose of the supplement is to provide sufficient recognition of qualifications (diplomas, degrees, certificates etc). It is designed to provide a
description of the nature, level context and status of the studies that were pursued and successfully completed by the individual named on the original
qualifications to which this supplement is appended. It should be free from any value judgements, equivalence statements or suggestions about
recognition. Information in all eight sections should be provided. Where Information is not provided, an explanation should give the reason why.
In hard copy format this Higher Education Achievement Report is printed in black ink on paper watermarked with the crest of the University and carries
the official University hologram. It is not valid unless in this format.

Credit Level
Credit is awarded to a learner in recognition of the achievement of designated learning outcomes at
a specific level and the level is an indicator of the relative complexity of learning. Credit values
indicate the amount of learning expected and are expressed in UK value (CATS), however, these can
be assimilated to ECTS, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System by dividing the CATS
value by two
Undergraduate- Each year is normally equivalent to 120 CATS, year 1 is at level 4, year 2 level 5
year 3 level 6 and year 4 (where appropriate) level 7.
Postgraduate Masters Degrees are normally 180 CATS at level 6/7 with at least 120 CATS at level 7.
Classification
Undergraduate- (pre 2010 student intake) Classification is based on the marks from years 2 and 3
(plus 4 where appropriate) and reflects the individual's performance across the whole degree
programme. All marks are calculated based on a 100% point scale. The calculation of the
classification does vary sligthly between programmes although the basic calculation is that half of
the marks attained are in particular class and the average mark calculated from all contributing
marks is no more than 2% below the class boundary.
Undergraduate - 2011 entry onwards) Classification is based on the marks from years 2 and 3 (plus
4 where appropriate) and reflects the individual's preformance across the whole degree programme.
All marks are calculated on a 24 point scale. The calculation of the classification does vary slightly
between programmes although the basic calculation is based on the students overall average
aggregation score.
Postgraduate - Classification reflects the individual's performance across the whole degree
programme. All marks are calculated based on a 100% point scale.
